**Step 11:** Grouping by marital status and gender, then plotting a bar graph with gender as a legend, showcasing that married women are the primary buyers.

**Step 12:** Generating a count plot for occupation, with IT (1583), healthcare (1408), and aviation (1310) being the top three occupations.

**Step 13:** Plotting a bar graph to illustrate the distribution of sold products across food, clothing, and electronics categories.

**Step 14:** Concluding with a final bar graph showcasing the most sold products along with their respective IDs.


**Conclusion:**

Through a comprehensive analysis of consumer behavior, this project has provided valuable insights into the purchasing patterns and preferences of individuals. The data highlights significant trends such as the dominance of female buyers, particularly in the 26-35 age group, and the influence of marital status on purchasing decisions, with married women emerging as the primary consumers. Moreover, it identifies key contributing states to overall sales, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Additionally, insights into popular occupations and product categories further enrich our understanding of consumer behavior dynamics. By leveraging such insights, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings to better cater to the preferences and needs of their target audience, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving revenue growth.
